# Changelog

Notable changes to Zentinelle. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Astrolift installs and clusters (#389). An admin generates a one-time
  enrollment code (Settings > Astrolift, or `manage.py
  astrolift_enrollment_code`), and Astrolift exchanges it for an install
  credential through `POST /api/zentinelle/v1/astrolift/connect`. With that
  credential it registers each cluster and receives the cluster gateway's
  credential, scoped to the install's tenants or a subset of them. It can also
  rotate a credential with an overlap, revoke a cluster, or disconnect. Gateways
  report health, version and counters through
  `POST .../astrolift/clusters/<id>/heartbeat`. Every change is audited per
  tenant, without the code or any credential.
- Gateway credentials can expire (`expires_at`). A rotation through the
  Astrolift API uses this to let the earlier credential keep working for a
  while.
- Gateway: per-tenant provider keys (#380). The gateway injects the provider
  key the agent's tenant stored in Zentinelle (Settings > LLM providers), read
  through the new `POST /api/zentinelle/v1/gateway/provider-key` and cached for
  60 seconds. Each release of a key is audited with the gateway's name, without
  the value.
- Registered gateways: each gateway is a registration scoped to an explicit set
  of tenants, with its own credential (`sk_gateway_...`, stored as a bcrypt
  hash). A key is released only for a tenant in the gateway's scope, so one
  leaked cluster exposes only its own tenants; a gateway or a single credential
  is revoked on its own. Managed with `manage.py gateway_credential` (register,
  mint, scope, list, revoke).
- The gateway reads its credential from `ZENTINELLE_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL`, or else
  the file at `ZENTINELLE_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL_FILE` (default
  `/var/run/zentinelle/gateway-credential`), waits up to 60 seconds for the file
  at startup, and reads it again when the backend refuses it, so rotation needs
  no restart. The Kubernetes manifest mounts it from a Secret.
- Standalone compose needs no configuration: the backend registers a gateway
  named `local` for the install's tenant and writes its credential into a
  volume both containers mount.

### Changed

- The gateway never forwards a client-supplied provider key: `Authorization`,
  `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key` and Google's `key` query parameter are dropped
  on every request.
- **Breaking:** the gateway no longer uses its own env provider keys unless
  `ALLOW_ENV_PROVIDER_KEYS=true`, and refuses to start with no credential
  (variable or file) and no allowed env key. Compose installs keep working
  through the local gateway; any other deployment registers its gateway and
  gives it the credential.

### Deprecated

- `ALLOW_ENV_PROVIDER_KEYS`. Still honoured, with a warning at startup, and to
  be removed in a future release: store provider keys per tenant in Zentinelle
  instead.
